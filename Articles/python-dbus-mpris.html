      <h2>HOWTO: Connect and control your media player with python and dbus</h2>
      In this guide we'll be using Python 3 although you may be able to apply this to Python 2.4 and above with minor adjustments.<br>
      We'll connect to a media player which implements the <b>Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification</b> or MPRIS for short. Most popular players like Audacious, Amarok, Clementine, VLC etc will work.<br>
      This can be useful for purposes like priting metadata of the current track on <a href="../Projects/conky-cards.html">conky</a> and controling the player with widgets. For a particular example, Clementine, for some reason would not bind the media keys on my keyboard for global shortcuts, so with the help of a python script I made the keybindings directly in Openbox.<br>
      I made this guide because I couldn't find a simple guide like this myself, I had to scour through the D-bus and MPRIS specifications, hopefully, this will make it easier for someone else.
      Let's get started, launch a terminal with the python interpreter and put on some music!
      <h3>D-Bus Basics</h3>
      DBus is message bus system which allows <i>Inter-process communication</i> i.e it allows different processes to talk to each other and even different instances of the same application or service.<br>
      The <i>dbus daemon</i> runs in the background allowing applications to connect to this <i>daemon</i> using the <i>libdbus</i> library and it's wrappers for different languages and frameworks.<br>
      Communication is done using a <b>bus</b>, each application is granted a unique name (e.g. a unique name could be <i>:1-45</i> or <i>:2-16</i>) when it connects to the bus.
      The application may request a familiar bus name (based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation">Reversed domain name</a> convention) e.g. <i>org.freedesktop.PowerManagement, com.Skype.API and org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.clementine</i><br>
      Each application or service can have multiple <b>object paths</b> representing a unique object within the application, they look like filesystme paths e.g. <i>/org/mpris/MediaPlayer2</i><br>
      <b>Interfaces</b> act like namespaces, within which <b>Methods</b> and <b>Signals</b> are defined.<br>
      Therefore, to make a method call you need:
      <ul>
        <li>Bus name</li>
        <li>Object path</li>
        <li>Interface name</li>
      </ul>
      Some applications may also have <b>Properties</b>, these properties could be set or retrieved through the <i>org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties</i> interface. More on this later.<br>
      There are mainly two two buses, the <b>Session Bus</b> and the <b>System Bus</b>
      The system bus is a session independent bus which is used by system services such as <i>udev</i> or <i>NetworkManager</i> whereas a session bus is unique for the current user session.
      It used by desktop applications and it is this bus we will be interested in for this guide.<br>
      <h3>Connecting to the D-Bus daemon with Python</h3>
<pre>
>>> import dbus
>>> bus = dbus.SessionBus()
</pre>
      In the first line, we import dbus and in the second line we make an object of the class <b>SessionBus</b>.<br>
      This class will makes us a connection with the session bus granting us a unique name which can retrieved with the <span class="inline-pre">get_unique_name()</span> method.
      Try this
<pre>
>>> bus.get_unique_name()
'1.113'
</pre>
      Your unique name will vary<br>
      We can also request a name with the method <span class="inline-pre">request_name()</span> following the reverse domain convention.
<pre>
>>> bus.request_name('io.github.amhndu.test')
</pre>
      A return value of 1 implies that you have succesfully acqured the name.<br>
      This class also allows us to list all the services/applications registered with the session bus:
<pre>
>>> for service in bus.list_names():
...     print(service)
</pre>
      In the list you'll also see the name we requested above.<br>
      You can even expose your python application with an API on dbus with this module but it is beyond this article's scope.<br>
      Note: D-bus, unlike python, is strongly typed and the python dbus library has wrapper classes for datatypes to faciliate interfacing dbus methods and python, thus the methods in the dbus module return these wrapper classes which can be implicitly converted to python native data types.
      <h3>Connecting to the player</h3>
      The <a href="#mpris-spec">MPRIS 2.0</a> spec defines that the player must request a name prefixed with <i>org.mpris.MediaPlayer2</i>.
      Therefore a player can have a name of form <i>org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.clementine</i> where the name ends the the name of the player.<br>
      To find out all the services of this form, you can run:
<pre>
>>> import re
>>> for service in bus.list_names():
...     if re.match('org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.', service):
...             print(service)
...
org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.clementine
org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.vlc
</pre>
      As you can see in output, I had two players --vlc and clementine-- opened.<br>
      Once you've found the service name of your player, we can get an object:
<pre>
>>> player = dbus.SessionBus().get_object('org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.clementine', '/org/mpris/MediaPlayer2')
</pre>
      The first argument to <span class="inline-pre">get_object()</span> is the service name, while the second is the object path. The object path we've used is defined by <a href="#mpris-spec">MPRIS</a>.<br>
      Try printing these attributes of <span class="inline-pre">player</span> -- <span class="inline-pre">bus_name</span> and <span class="inline-pre">requested_bus_name</span>
      <h3>Making method calls</h3>
      To make method calls, we call the method name directly on the object, giving it the associated interface name.<br>
      With <a href="#mpris-spec">MPRIS</a>, the interface <i>org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player</i> defines methods like <span class="inline-pre">Next()</span>, therefore to switch the track to the next in playlist, we call <span class="inline-pre">player.Next()</span> and set the <span class="inline-pre">dbus_interface</span> keyword argument as the interface
<pre>
>>> player.Next(dbus_interface='org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player')
</pre>
      You should notice the track change.<br>
      Similarly we can call <span class="inline-pre">Previous(), Play(), Pause() or PlayPause()</span><br>
      But specifying the interface on each call is verbose, we can instead get an interface object once and rid ourselves of specifying it each time.
<pre>
>>> interface = dbus.Interface(player, dbus_interface='org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player')
>>> interface.Next()
>>> interface.Previous()
>>> interface.Pause()
>>> interface.PlayPause() #Play if paused, pause if playing
</pre>
      Very straightforward, isn't it ?
      <h3>Properties</h3>
      Getting properties is a little indirect. We'll have to use the <i>org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties</i> interface to get the property.<br>
      This interface has three methods -- <span class="inline-pre">Get(), Set(), GetAll()</span> with which you can get or set the property in an interface.<br>
      Therefore to get a property in <i>org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player</i> interface, we call <span class="inline-pre">Get()</span> in <i>org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties</i> with the name of the interface and our property to retrieve it and <span class="inline-pre">Set()</span> to set it.<br>
      In python:
<pre>
>>> volume = player.Get('org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player', 'Volume',
...             dbus_interface='org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties')
>>> print(volume)
</pre>
      We can of course make an interface object to faciliate making frequent calls.
<pre>
>>> property_interface = dbus.Interface(player, dbus_interface='org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties')
>>> volume = property_interface.Get('org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player', 'Volume')
>>> print(volume)
0.9
>>> property_interface.Set('org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player', 'Volume', volume-0.2)
</pre>
      Here, we make an interface object, retrieve the volume (which is a value between 0.0 to 1.0) and in the last line,
      change the volume.<br>
      The <span class="inline-pre">GetAll()</span> method can be used print all the properties defined in an interface. e.g.
<pre>
>>> for property, value in property_interface.GetAll('org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player').items():
...     print(property, ':', value)
</pre>
      You can see all the properties defined along with the  <i>Metadata</i> dictionary.
      <h3>Metadata</h3>
      A dictionary with <i>Metadata</i> of the current track playing can be obtained as above.
<pre>
>>> metadata = player.Get('org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player', 'Metadata',
...             dbus_interface='org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties')
</pre>
      The peculiar thing about this dictionary is the naming system of the attributes.
      This is an example of it's contents:
<pre>
>>> for attr, value in metadata.items():
...     print(attr, '\t', value)
...

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      Now, you should be able to make your own scripts or just use the interactive interpreter to control your media player. You can have a look at <a href="../Projects/mediaplayer.py">mediaplayer.py</a>, a python script I made which I use to print metadata in <a href="../Projects/conky-cards.html">conky</a> and make keybindings for clementine, which I was unable to do through clementine itself. For more information, see the D-Bus and MPRIS specifications in the references section below.
