      <description>An NES emulator written in C++ for nothing but fun.
Roughly 40-50% of games should work (ie. games that use either no mapper or mappers 1, 2 or 3).
Examples of games that have been tested to run (but NOT limited to):
(USA/Japan or World versions only i.e. NTSC compatible)

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a teaser!
from expr import * native_lambda = lambda x: x * (x - 1) magic_lambda = X * (X - 1) print(native_lambda(7)) # 42 print(magic_lambda(7)) # 42 print(magic_lambda(7, evaluator=Differentiator())) # x * (x - 1) = x * x - x # Derivate = 2*x - 1 # 13 You may have seen this magic if you&amp;rsquo;ve used a machine-learning framework like TensorFlow, which provide an auto-gradient feature for any tensor expressions you build.</description>

      <title>Writing custom serde deserializers, the easy way</title>

      <description>Serde is a great library for serializing/deserializing in Rust. It allows you to directly convert rust data structures using a few attributes. Most of the time, It Just Works â„¢ and when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, you can write your own serializers or deserializers!
Problem at hand: There exists a type which can be parsed from a string but serde has no built in support for it. For the purposes of an example, let&amp;rsquo;s say the type is std::net::IpAddr and forget that serde has support for it already.</description>

      <description>A better seiyuu list.
It lets you search anime voice actors and browse all of their character roles. Unlike the pages from anilist/MAL, this gives you more information on the anime alongside their roles, this allows you to sort the list by say the anime popularity or scores. This is particularly useful because popular voice actors tend to have many roles, so looking at their super long list can get you lost.</description>

      <description>I finally have a new post after about two years!
This is the customary blog post where I talk about moving to the new static site generator.
Hugo.
This is way more flexible and easier to maintain than my previous setup, which was a hand-crafted website written using vanilla HTML and CSS. After keeping it for about 4 years I realized it was time to move on. It was a bit of a pain to add anything using raw HTML.</description>

Scratchpad plugin. A plugin that helps you keep a list of &amp;ldquo;scratches&amp;rdquo;, temporary code files that don&amp;rsquo;t belong to a project that you can run. Helps you experiment with code, or run small programs that don&amp;rsquo;t need a full project/build system.

      <description>Conky let&amp;rsquo;s you display system information on your desektop using a configuration file. You can set different colors and fonts for the content, however setting the font involved repeating the font settings inline for each block of text that required it! I made a patch to allow creating font variables where you pre-define the settings and then conveniently reuse them.</description>

      <description>Obfuscate: tr.v. -cated, -cating, -cates.
i. To render obscure.
ii. To darken. To confuse: his emotions obfuscated his judgment. [Lat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) + Lat. fuscare, to darken &amp;lt; fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n. obfuscatory adj (taken from IOCCC)
The Why You learn lesser known aspects of the language Job security. Write obfuscated code and make sure no one else can maintain it but you! It&amp;rsquo;s fun. &amp;rsquo;nuff said. The Plan We&amp;rsquo;ll be making a small C program which generates samples of a song (we&amp;rsquo;ll stick with the &amp;lsquo;Happy Birthday&amp;rsquo; song), whose output will then be piped to aplay.</description>

      <description>I stumbled on this bug with my NES emulator where the ROMs won&amp;rsquo;t open under Windows but had worked without a hitch on Linux and macOS.
I had been developing on Linux and occasionally it tested on macOS. So it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until quite late into the development that I found that the emulator can&amp;rsquo;t open any ROM files on Windows.
This bug had me really perpexled, for why the emulator breaks only under Windows.</description>

      <description>In this guide we&amp;rsquo;ll be using Python 3 although you may be able to apply this to Python 2.4 and above with minor adjustments. Since D-Bus is only used by Linux and BSD distributions, needless to say, this will only work with *nix systems
We&amp;rsquo;ll connect to a media player which implements the Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification or MPRIS for short. Most popular players like Audacious, Amarok, Clementine, VLC etc will work.</description>

      <description>I wrote this script some years ago to show currently playing music on conky. I also used this to bind some mediaplayer keys from Openbox to control playback and volume.
Download it here: https://github.com/amhndu/conky-cards/blob/master/mediaplayer.py
This is most likely in need of some re-write. Mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m a better programmer now compared to when I wrote it 4 years ago and the code is hard to look at currently.</description>
