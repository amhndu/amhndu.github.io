      <description>KDevelop is a cross-platform IDE that I primarily use for all my C++ IDE needs.
I try to add/fix things when I can.
Some notable contributions:
Scratchpad plugin. A plugin that helps you keep a list of &amp;ldquo;scratches&amp;rdquo;, temporary code files that don&amp;rsquo;t belong to a project that you can run. Helps you experiment with code, or run small programs that don&amp;rsquo;t need a full project/build system.
Assistant to automatically generate header guard if they&amp;rsquo;re missing in header files</description>

      <description>Clementine is a music player and library organizer made with Qt.
I helped refactor away from deprecated Qt5 functions.
Made sorting in playlist ignore &amp;ldquo;The&amp;rdquo; or any other configurable prefixes, which is a more natural way to order on album/artist names</description>

      <description>Conky let&amp;rsquo;s you display system information on your desektop using a configuration file. You can set different colors and fonts for the content, however setting the font involved repeating the font settings inline for each block of text that required it! I made a patch to allow creating font variables where you pre-define the settings and then conveniently reuse them.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to and help maintain HotBot, a discord bot written in Kotlin. It has many features, including fun, administration, channel management, an internal permissions system as well as some forms of anti-spam.</description>
