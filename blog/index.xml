      <description>I finally have a new post after about two years!
This is the customary blog post where I talk about moving to the new static site generator.
Hugo.
This is way more flexible and easier to maintain than my previous setup, which was a hand-crafted website written using vanilla HTML and CSS. After keeping it for about 4 years I realized it was time to move on. It was a bit of a pain to add anything using raw HTML.</description>

The Why  You learn lesser known aspects of the language Job security. Write obfuscated code and make sure no one else can maintain it but you! It&amp;rsquo;s fun.</description>

      <description>I stumbled on this bug with my NES emulator where the ROMs won&amp;rsquo;t open under Windows but had worked without a hitch on Linux and macOS.
I had been developing on Linux and occasionally it tested on macOS. So it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until quite late into the development that I found that the emulator can&amp;rsquo;t open any ROM files on Windows.
This bug had me really perpexled, for why the emulator breaks only under Windows.</description>

      <title>Connect and control your media player with python and dbus using MPRIS</title>

      <description>In this guide we&amp;rsquo;ll be using Python 3 although you may be able to apply this to Python 2.4 and above with minor adjustments. Since D-Bus is only used by Linux and BSD distributions, needless to say, this will only work with *nix systems
We&amp;rsquo;ll connect to a media player which implements the Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification or MPRIS for short. Most popular players like Audacious, Amarok, Clementine, VLC etc will work.</description>
